# Dashboards

Dashboards are a key component of FBIS - they provide tabular and graphical (via charts and maps) breakdowns and visualisations of taxa encountered at sites. Beyond simply enumerating taxa, the dashboards also show aggregate information such as trends over time, conservation status, site sensitivity etc.

FBIS has seven dashboard visualisations:

1. Taxon dashboard
2. Single-site biodiversity dashboards
3. Multi-site biodiversity dashboards
4. Single-site SASS dashboard
5. Multi-site SASS dashboard
6. Water temperature dashboard
7. Physico-chemical dashboard

In the following sections we provide a brief overview of the key dashboard components and then of the different dashboards:

* **[Key Dashboard Components:](key-components.md)** A brief description of the different dashboard components.
* **[SASS Dashboard components:](sass-components.md)** A brief description of the SASS dashboard components.
* **[Taxon dashboard:](taxon.md)** A brief description of the Taxon dashboard.
* **[Single-site biodiversity dashboards:](single-site-biodiversity.md)** A brief description of the Single-site biodiversity dashboards.
* **[Multi-site biodiversity dashboards:](multi-site-biodiversity.md)** A brief description of the Multi-site biodiversity dashboards.
* **[Single-site SASS dashboard:](single-site-sass.md)** A brief description of the Single-site SASS dashboard.
* **[Multi-site SASS dashboard:](multi-site-sass.md)** A brief description of the Multi-site SASS dashboard.
* **[Water temperature dashboard:](water-temperature.md)** A brief description of the Water temperature dashboard.
* **[Physico-chemical dashboard:](physico-chemical.md)** A brief description of the Physico-chemical dashboard.
