# BIMS Administration Guide

This section contains all documentation relevant to administration procedures.

The content is divided into four sections:

* **[Biodiversity Data](biodiversity-data/index.md)**, which provides a guide for biodiversity data administrators to mobilize and ingest biodiversity data.
* **[Working with GeoServer](geoserver/index.md)**, which guides administrators through the process of publishing spatial data in GeoServer and how to do basic cartography.
* **[GIS Data in BIMS](geocontext/index.md)**, which describes the high level concepts of the GeoContext subsystem.
* **[Customisation](customisation/index.md)**, which guides administrators through customising their BIMS instance.
