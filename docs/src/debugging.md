# Debugging

## VSCode
In VsCode to run and debug the application use the following command:

`python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

Now in the ports, see the port `8000` ports and open the one the local Address in your browser.

## Pycharm
In Pycharm you can run the server using the green triangle next to the Django server
label in the run configurations pull down. Debug will also work, and you will be
able to step through views etc. as you work.
