The Freshwater Biodiversity Information System (FBIS), South Africa.

The FBIS serves as a community platform for inventory and maintenance of freshwater biodiversity data with an end goal to assist the evaluation of long-term change in river biodiversity and ecosystem condition in South Africa.

This project is funded by the JRS Biodiversity Foundation and SANBI, and implemented by the FRC and Kartoza.

By signing up and creating an account you will be able to (1) explore the map, (2) query the data in the system, (3) download maps, data, graphs and reports and (4) create a site and upload data. If you do not sign up, you will still have access to all the above functions except the ability to upload data.

The FBIS v3 release includes access to FBIS, a FBIS v3 user manual (accessed via the 'Help' tab on the top bar of the site) and a short ‘how to’ video series available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSbcS_PS6gw07F6a8HnDJPt3BHcnqIP2O).

These aids should help you to navigate your way around the system and test out the main functions, features and work flows, as well as flag any issues you pick up on while testing.

Any questions can be directed to fbis@frcsa.org.za.

We look forward to receiving your feedback!
