# Developer workflow

The source code of django-bims is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/). You need a personal account on GitHub to be 
able to create repositories or collaborate on other projects.

### Getting code upstream

In an open-source project, users must properly integrate their contributions with others. To ensure 
that all contributors are pulling from the same place, you need to copy the upstream repository into a user's account, 
and git provides an option called _**fork**_.

![Fork the project](img/fork.png)

After forking the project, 

```
$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:Fanevanjanahary/django-bims.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:Fanevanjanahary/django-bims.git (push)
upstream	git@github.com:kartoza/django-bims.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:kartoza/django-bims.git (push)

```
