# Documentation

In this section of the documentation, we explain how to work with the documentation. The content is organised as follows:

* **[Overview:](./overview.md)** Here we outline the documentation system and the standard workflows needed.
* **[Context help:](./context-help.md)** Here we outline the procedure for adding context help into the application and linking it to this documentation tree.
